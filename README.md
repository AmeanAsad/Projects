# Random-Projects



File Inlucdes some random code projects/problems that I work on and find interesting. 


1. Gaussian Elimination: 
The program is able to solve any n sized systems of equations. It performs three functions:

       a) Makes an augmented matrix.
       b) Puts the matrix in row echelon form.
       c) Performs back substitution and outputs the answers for the x values

Only problem with the code is that it won't recognize if the system has no solutions so make sure you know the system has a solution. Sould be an easy fix, probably too lazy to add it. Basically, if it displays an error, then the system probably has no solution. 


2. Vigenere Cipher:
 
Was inspired to do this after I read the Code Book by Simon Singhe. Just a code that ciphers text messages using
the famous Vigenere Cipher method. It also  includes a function that revereses the cipher with the same keyword.
