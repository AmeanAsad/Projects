# Random-Projects



File Inlucdes some random code projects/problems that I work on and find interesting. 
1. Slack Bot:
       During work this summer I was thinking that I really hated having to manually write down every inventory item
       that I used and I wished that there was an easier way to search for inventory items rather than going and searching
       through hundreds of items. So I created a inventory database in python using the excel file on inventory items. 
       I linked the inventory to a Slack Bot on Slack and wrote some python code to enable inventory logging from slack and 
       also implemented a search function to search through inventory items. Also, I put in some morning greeting messages by the bot
       along with a morning weather report thing. 

2. Gaussian Elimination: 
The program is able to solve any n sized systems of equations. It performs three functions:

       a) Makes an augmented matrix.
       b) Puts the matrix in row echelon form.
       c) Performs back substitution and outputs the answers for the x values

Only problem with the code is that it won't recognize if the system has no solutions so make sure you know the system has a solution. Sould be an easy fix, probably too lazy to add it. Basically, if it displays an error, then the system probably has no solution. 


3. Vigenere Cipher:
 
Was inspired to do this after I read the Code Book by Simon Singhe. Just a code that ciphers text messages using
the famous Vigenere Cipher method. It also  includes a function that revereses the cipher with the same keyword.
